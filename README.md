# Fake News Detection

This project implements a **Fake News Detection System** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The system classifies news articles as **real** or **fake** based on the content using machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF** for text vectorization.

## Project Overview

With the rise of misinformation and fake news, detecting the authenticity of news articles has become crucial. This project uses NLP techniques to automatically detect whether a given news article is real or fake. The classification model is trained on a labeled dataset and utilizes **TF-IDF** vectorization for transforming text data into numerical features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  The text data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise. This includes:
  - Removing stopwords (common words that don't add much value, like "the", "is").
  - Tokenizing the text into smaller units (words).
  - Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.
  - Lemmatization or stemming, reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

- **Text Vectorization (TF-IDF)**:  
  TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) converts text into numerical features that machine learning models can process. It captures the importance of each word within the document and across the entire dataset. Words that are more frequent in the article but rare in the dataset are considered more significant.

- **Modeling (Logistic Regression)**:  
  The classification model used is **Logistic Regression**, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks. It learns from the training data and predicts whether a news article is fake or real based on the patterns in the text.

- **Accuracy**:  
  The model's accuracy is evaluated based on the percentage of correct predictions it makes on unseen data. A higher accuracy indicates a better-performing model. The model is trained on the **Fake News Dataset** and achieves an accuracy of **XX%** (replace with your actual accuracy).
